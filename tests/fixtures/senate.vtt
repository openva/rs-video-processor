00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.602
suspended for the senate bill
362?

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:21.704
This is a recorded vote.

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.806
All those in favor of the motion

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.646
will record their votes aye.
Are the senators ready to vote?

00:27:32.116 --> 00:27:34.116
And those opposed no.

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.887
Have all the senators voted?
>> senator bell, how do you

00:27:37.987 --> 00:27:39.588
vote?
>> aye.

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:41.524
>> senator five l how do you

00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:44.561
>> I vote aye.
>> senator howell, how do you

>> aye.

00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:51.667
>> senator Mcpike, how do you
vote?
>> aye.
>> thank you.

00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:54.170
>> does any senator desire to
change their votes?

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.839
The clerk will close the roll.

00:28:00.107 --> 00:28:02.107
>> ayes 39, NOs 0.

00:28:04.213 --> 00:28:07.146
>> the rules are suspended and
dispensed with the third

00:28:08.617 --> 00:28:10.284
constitutional reading.
Finally.

00:28:16.524 --> 00:28:18.158
The senator from king george,
senator stuart.

00:28:18.527 --> 00:28:20.527
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT, i

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.130
move that the bill pass.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.650
>> the senator has the floor.

00:28:28.636 --> 00:28:30.636
>> senate bill 362 essentially

00:28:31.304 --> 00:28:33.304
requires cyclers who are riding

00:28:44.485 --> 00:28:46.485
to abreast in a lane, which

00:28:48.988 --> 00:28:50.988
they're allowed to do, to ride

00:28:51.158 --> 00:28:52.824
single file when a vehicle is
behind them.

00:28:57.197 --> 00:28:59.197
We passed a bill that bicyclists

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:02.100
can ride abreast to lane of
travel, and they don't have to

00:29:03.668 --> 00:29:05.668
move out of the way.

00:29:06.104 --> 00:29:09.740
I'm sure that's fine in some
areas of the commonwealth, and

00:29:10.476 --> 00:29:12.476
not fine in others.

00:29:13.212 --> 00:29:15.280
I had a constituent who at 5:30
was drive to go work.

00:29:18.284 --> 00:29:20.952
He had a dually truck, a six
horse trailer on the back of it.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.210
He had a horse in the trailer.

00:29:24.256 --> 00:29:26.256
He came around a turn and came

00:29:27.459 --> 00:29:28.825
up on two people riding
bicycles.

00:29:31.497 --> 00:29:32.930
He was doing 50, they were doing
5 mph.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.366
Now instead of running over
them.

00:29:37.468 --> 00:29:39.468
He put the truck in the ditch.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.720
Wrecked the truck, wrecked the

00:29:43.408 --> 00:29:45.408
trailer, horse broke its leg and

00:29:47.544 --> 00:29:49.544
they had to shoot the horse.

00:29:49.681 --> 00:29:51.916
A very sad story but very much
in line with the concern that

00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:56.553
many of us had when this bill
was passed.

00:29:56.854 --> 00:29:58.455
This is important to members of
this body.

00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:06.629
I tried to come up with a mod
streak to that legislation that

00:30:07.531 --> 00:30:10.265
says if you have a vehicle over
taking you from behind, you need

00:30:11.402 --> 00:30:13.736
to move into single file to let
that vehicle go around you.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.380
And if we don't, people are

00:30:17.506 --> 00:30:19.506
going to get killed.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.310
We were lucky in this instance

00:30:22.846 --> 00:30:25.580
where the guy actually saw them
and chose to wreck his truck

00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:27.416
instead of running over two
people.

00:30:28.518 --> 00:30:31.453
but we're not always going to be
lucky like that.

00:30:36.392 --> 00:30:39.270
So this is a reasonable measure.
The senator from senior fairfax

00:30:39.996 --> 00:30:41.996
put his amendment in which

00:30:42.664 --> 00:30:44.664
essentially says if you fail to

00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:47.134
move into single file formation,

00:30:48.404 --> 00:30:50.504
that won't constitute negligence
per se.

00:30:51.574 --> 00:30:53.740
That was a favor amendment with
regard to civil action for

00:30:55.343 --> 00:30:57.343
people who are involved in these

00:30:57.379 --> 00:31:00.880
lawsuits and kept the law in a
pretty good place on the civil
side.

00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:02.581
So with that, I would ask that

00:31:08.757 --> 00:31:10.757
the bill pass.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.796
>> the senator from james city,
senator norment.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, I rise to

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:20.334
see if the senator from king
george would yield for a
question.

00:31:21.135 --> 00:31:23.135
>> would the senator yield?

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:26.105
>> I will yield.
>> senator oh norment.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.376
>> my question is, is it a
reasonable interpretation of

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.110
this amendment and the bill as

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:36.648
amended that would prohibit
bicyclists from riding on any

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.650
routes other than a designated

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.655
bike trail?
>> senator?

00:31:44.423 --> 00:31:46.423
>> I'm sorry, would the

00:31:47.793 --> 00:31:50.228
gentleman restate the question?
>> senator norment?
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, my question

00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:53.896
is would this prohibit

00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:57.299
bicyclists riding on primary or

00:31:57.935 --> 00:31:59.935
secondary roads and restricting

00:32:03.675 --> 00:32:06.310
them only to bike trails?
>> senator stuart.
>> no, it would not.

00:32:07.312 --> 00:32:09.312
They can still ride on the

00:32:09.414 --> 00:32:11.515
highways and they can still ride
abreast.

00:32:15.153 --> 00:32:17.153
And suggest the senator get his

00:32:18.556 --> 00:32:19.990
own bill.
[Chuckling]

professionally as possible.

00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:06.559

This caused our law enforcement,

their shotguns by secondary

>> senate bill 389 repeals an
antiquated part of virginia law

00:36:42.444 --> 00:36:44.444
that used to be similar to in

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.282
the -- let me start by saying the
1945s,

00:36:51.652 --> 00:36:53.652
 -- 1950s 45 states had

00:36:54.422 --> 00:36:56.422
laws that adult children support

00:36:57.558 --> 00:36:59.793
their parents if they become
destitute, and they would face a

00:37:02.628 --> 00:37:05.561
fine of $500 or a year in prison
if they had the means to do so.

00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:09.966
It's rarely used and outdated
statute.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.400
There are many of assistance for

00:37:17.308 --> 00:37:19.977
indigent adults, medicare,
medicaid, and financial

00:37:20.144 --> 00:37:22.144
assistance.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.915
Several states have repeal
led

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.120
them including maryland, iowa,

00:37:31.422 --> 00:37:33.422
new hampshire, idaho.

00:37:34.258 --> 00:37:36.258
And when a constituent brought

00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:39.761
this to my attention, I found a
great law article about examples

00:37:41.463 --> 00:37:42.863
of the law in virginia being
misused.

00:37:43.465 --> 00:37:45.465
I'll just give two examples

00:37:45.834 --> 00:37:47.834
before I sit down.

00:37:51.406 --> 00:37:53.406
They had a brother who ran his

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.440
mother's finances in into the

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.848
ground and sued his sister for
financial support after his

00:38:02.316 --> 00:38:04.316
mistakes and burdened her with

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.620
financial fees, a man was

00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:14.726
permitted to sue his brother to

00:38:14.828 --> 00:38:17.730
support their parents luxury
assisted living bill.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.990
This is an antiquated law and I

00:38:21.101 --> 00:38:23.101
hope we repeal it.

00:38:23.103 --> 00:38:25.103
With that I move the bill pass.

00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:27.637
>> the question is shall senate

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.460
roll.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.820
>> ayes 39, NOs 1.

00:39:19.224 --> 00:39:21.224
>> well, senator saslaw.

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:25.661
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, this is a

00:39:26.431 --> 00:39:29.132
fall out from the 2020 session,
we passed a bill and I was the

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.534
sponsor of that, and there was a

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:36.105
house bill 37 and the governor

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.807
amended it and made it

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:42.110
retroactive to JULY 1, 2020, for
healthcare providers, emergency

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.180
medical people, firefighters,

00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:48.651
law enforcement, you know, to

00:39:49.586 --> 00:39:51.586
get workman's comp if they came

00:39:52.755 --> 00:39:54.755
down with covid.

00:39:56.626 --> 00:39:59.128
It wasn't a major problem
because 97% these professions

00:40:00.497 --> 00:40:02.497
have all gotten vaccinations.

00:40:04.633 --> 00:40:06.633
But just a handful that haven't.

00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:10.638
So what this says is
is that if you

00:40:11.374 --> 00:40:13.374
refuse the vaccination, and then

00:40:13.543 --> 00:40:15.543
you come down with covid, you're

00:40:17.346 --> 00:40:19.581
not eligible for workman's comp.
None of the organizations

00:40:20.483 --> 00:40:21.850
affected by this were opposed to
the bill.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.520
Like I said, one of the reasons

00:40:25.821 --> 00:40:27.821
is that 97% of the membership

00:40:27.823 --> 00:40:29.823
have all been vaccinated.

00:40:29.925 --> 00:40:31.925
But if you do turn it down, and

00:40:32.361 --> 00:40:34.361
then you come down with covid,

00:40:35.996 --> 00:40:37.631
you're not eligible for
workman's comp.

00:40:38.632 --> 00:40:40.632
And with that, I would move the

00:40:43.437 --> 00:40:45.437
passage of the bill.

00:40:46.441 --> 00:40:47.908
>> the senator from rockingham
county.

00:40:48.576 --> 00:40:51.311
Senator obenshain.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, speaking to
the bill.

00:40:52.981 --> 00:40:55.415
>> the senator has the floor.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, members of

00:40:56.684 --> 00:40:58.684
the senate, I voted against this

00:40:58.853 --> 00:41:01.388
bill in committee, and I wanted
to put context on this.

00:41:03.858 --> 00:41:05.858
You know, vaccinations have

00:41:05.992 --> 00:41:08.940
absolutely been made wildly
available.
That's a great thing.

00:41:09.563 --> 00:41:11.563
It's a great thing that members

00:41:12.266 --> 00:41:14.232
of our first responders and
front line healthcare workers

00:41:16.336 --> 00:41:18.336
are taking advantage of those

00:41:19.306 --> 00:41:21.306
vaccinations and are doing so in

00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:23.374
great numbers.

00:41:23.844 --> 00:41:25.844
But my concern is that this is

00:41:26.813 --> 00:41:28.813
more of a political statement,

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.418
and I say that with great
respect to my frequent, the

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.420
senior senator from fairfax.

00:41:35.822 --> 00:41:38.290
It doesn't draw a line as to why
somebody MAY have decline

00:41:39.926 --> 00:41:41.926
ed to

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.290
accept the vaccination.

00:41:46.565 --> 00:41:49.501
These are the most over worked,
most stressed people in our

00:41:49.602 --> 00:41:51.870
communities, across the
commonwealth of virginia.

00:41:54.373 --> 00:41:57.273
They're people to whom we owe a
great debt of gratitude.

00:41:59.812 --> 00:42:01.812
Take for example, a young woman

00:42:02.547 --> 00:42:05.517
of child bearing age who just
makes a personal choice, I

00:42:05.818 --> 00:42:07.818
understand the risk.

00:42:08.352 --> 00:42:10.352
Because of my concern about the

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.890
impact upon my ability to have

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.590
children, I'm going to take the

00:42:17.762 --> 00:42:19.263
risk and decide not to have the
vaccination.

00:42:21.132 --> 00:42:23.132
I don't think we ought to be

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.680
punishing these people.

00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:29.500
This is an extremely small
number of folks.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.750
But you know what, that young

00:42:33.644 --> 00:42:36.412
woman who has concerns, who
didn't take the vaccination, she

00:42:38.249 --> 00:42:40.249
MAY be the one who gets covid,

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.918
who needs this workers
compensation benefit.

00:42:44.287 --> 00:42:46.655
This is going to deprive some of
those people we ought to be

00:42:48.624 --> 00:42:50.624
saying thanks to.

00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:53.695
Of the ability to receive
workers compensation benefits.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.650
And I don't see a real

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:09.642
meaningful benefit that we get
waiving a political fag.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.111
I don't think vaccinations are a
bad thing.

00:43:12.913 --> 00:43:14.913
I think they're a good thing.

00:43:14.915 --> 00:43:16.915
I've been vaccinated.

00:43:17.251 --> 00:43:19.285
I encourage everyone to get
vaccinated, boosted, and all

00:43:21.221 --> 00:43:23.557
that, but I think this sends the
wrong message and doesn't take

00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:26.192
into consideration the
individual circumstances of

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.560
individual members on the front

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.340
lines in our communities.

00:43:36.402 --> 00:43:39.138
>> the junior senator from
chesterfield, senator chase.

00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:43.441
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT, i

00:43:43.508 --> 00:43:45.508
would like to speak to the bill.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.990
>> the senator has the bill.

00:44:02.528 --> 00:44:04.528
>> if a company mandates a

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.230
worker for a vaccine.

00:44:08.768 --> 00:44:10.568
Will people pay damages if that
person is injured?

00:44:11.203 --> 00:44:13.203
>> I would say that this bill

00:44:13.405 --> 00:44:15.472
does not apply to that.
>> I appreciate the honest

00:44:18.777 --> 00:44:20.777
answer of the patron.

00:44:21.745 --> 00:44:23.580
>> senator from chesterfield.
>> speaking to the bill.

00:44:24.749 --> 00:44:26.749
>> the senator has the floor.

00:44:26.884 --> 00:44:29.785
>> we're forcing workers to get
vaccine, yet we're expecting

00:44:30.955 --> 00:44:32.955
them to assume the risk, the

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.725
responsibility, and the
financial liability and the risk

00:44:37.595 --> 00:44:39.595
to their health.

00:44:39.662 --> 00:44:41.662
Fully.

00:44:43.734 --> 00:44:45.734
I reject this one-size fits all

00:44:46.102 --> 00:44:48.437
approach to preventing
hospitalizations and death, when

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.642
as we saw in subcommittee there
were other options.

00:44:54.778 --> 00:44:57.680
And we need to allow virginians
to make that decision for

00:44:57.881 --> 00:44:59.881
themselves instead of deciding

00:45:01.251 --> 00:45:03.251
that they have to get a jab in

00:45:03.753 --> 00:45:05.753
order to keep their job.

00:45:05.755 --> 00:45:07.755
You know, MADAM PRESIDENT, not

00:45:08.157 --> 00:45:09.591
all virginians want to get a
vaccination.

00:45:12.633 --> 00:45:13.808
They've educated themselves on
the dangerous of these vaccines.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.630
We've just seen a report out by

00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:20.234
a military attorney showing all

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.670
the numbers of increased risks

00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:29.177
of myocarditis, cancer, you name
it.

00:45:30.279 --> 00:45:32.547
We do not know the long term
negative impacts of this

00:45:32.547 --> 00:45:34.547
vaccine.

00:45:36.118 --> 00:45:38.118
It has been around less than a

00:45:38.787 --> 00:45:40.820
year.
MADAM PRESIDENT, I would

00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:44.691
conclude my remarks by saying,

00:45:47.929 --> 00:45:49.929
we should not force employees to

00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:55.100
choose between a jab and a job.
It is their body.

00:45:55.203 --> 00:45:57.637
it is their choice.
We need to stop telling people

00:45:58.206 --> 00:46:00.339
that they can't work if they
don't get a jab.

00:46:07.248 --> 00:46:09.315
Thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT.
>> for what purpose does the

00:46:09.382 --> 00:46:11.818
senator rise?
>> just to briefly wrap up and

00:46:12.286 --> 00:46:14.353
respond.
I would say -- 

00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:17.958
>> if I could have others speak,
senator, and then I'll call on

00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:19.958
you.

00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:23.530
Thank you.
>> the senator from fairfax

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.532
city.
Senator petersen.

00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:27.433
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT,
speak to the bill.

00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:30.536
>> the senator has the floor.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, I think it

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.770
is important to remember that

00:46:33.706 --> 00:46:35.706
this is not telling people what

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.430
they condition or cannot do.

00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:40.311
It is saying whether or not they

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.948
can recover under workers
compensation.

00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:45.115
Everyone who owns a small

00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:47.651
business pays a tax that funds

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:52.524
our workers compensation system.
When people become ill,

00:46:53.225 --> 00:46:55.225
particularly from a preventable

00:46:59.598 --> 00:47:01.650
illness, that's a tax on our
system.

00:47:02.734 --> 00:47:05.136
This is a tax on our citizens.
People can make the choice that

00:47:05.437 --> 00:47:07.437
they're going to make.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.275
We're saying we're not going to
absorb that tax if it was

00:47:10.275 --> 00:47:12.810
avoidable.
That's all we're saying.

00:47:14.112 --> 00:47:15.578
>> the senator from lynchburg,
senator peake.

00:47:16.247 --> 00:47:19.215
>> yeah, I rise to speak to the
bill.
>> the senator has the floor.

00:47:20.518 --> 00:47:22.953
>> and just speak briefly to
what the senator from fairfax

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.622
just said.
You know we have three members

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.760
of this caucus, of the senator

00:47:32.196 --> 00:47:34.364
currently out due to
coronavirus, and I believe all

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.660
three of them were vaccinated.

00:47:38.734 --> 00:47:41.370
The senator from rockingham was
vaccinated, and was out.

00:47:41.972 --> 00:47:43.972
I am vaccinated and was out.

00:47:44.341 --> 00:47:46.341
So the vaccine does not keep you

00:47:47.744 --> 00:47:49.744
from getting the virus.

00:47:50.914 --> 00:47:52.613
And so while we would
distinguish between those who

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.750
catch the virus who are

00:47:56.119 --> 00:47:58.119
vaccinated and boosted, and let

00:47:58.253 --> 00:48:00.923
them get workers comp, but then
people who don't get the vaccine

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.890
but get the exact same virus the

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.260
rest of us got, we would not

00:48:10.764 --> 00:48:12.130
allow them to get workers comp
benefits?

00:48:13.634 --> 00:48:15.634
This is a mean-spirited bill,

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:18.838
and I ask you to vote against
it.

00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:20.839
>> the

00:48:22.909 --> 00:48:24.744
senator dunnavant.
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT, I

00:48:24.911 --> 00:48:27.446
wish to speak to the bill.
>> the senator has the floor.

00:48:27.681 --> 00:48:30.583
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT.
I just wanted to make a couple

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.840
of comments about the vaccine.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.320
The first is that we have an eye

00:48:40.892 --> 00:48:42.262
another must -- enormous body of
evidence.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.298
There is a lot of talk about
long-term concern about
vaccination.

00:48:48.234 --> 00:48:50.234
All the vaccinations we've been

00:48:51.103 --> 00:48:53.271
doing all these decades,
including covid, there is no

00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:58.243
evidence that there is long-term
consequence.

00:48:59.778 --> 00:49:01.811
Getting covid does.
10% get

00:49:05.249 --> 00:49:06.784
getting covid have long-term
consequences.

00:49:08.452 --> 00:49:10.452
Let me explain why we don't

00:49:13.425 --> 00:49:15.425
worry about long-term

00:49:18.396 --> 00:49:20.396
vaccination

00:49:30.942 --> 00:49:33.911
consequence of vaccination.
With vaccination, you have a

00:49:36.714 --> 00:49:38.714
very concise, precise exposure

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:41.830
to an inknock

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.420
innoculant.

00:49:45.456 --> 00:49:47.456
And it is short lived.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.627
The vaccine triggers your immune
system and it is gone in two oh

00:49:50.627 --> 00:49:52.627
three weeks.

00:49:52.996 --> 00:49:54.996
That's why we're so confident as

00:49:55.232 --> 00:49:57.766
people discern getting
vaccination that vaccination

00:49:58.835 --> 00:50:01.670
does not have long-term
consequences.
The second thing I would say as

00:50:03.772 --> 00:50:05.641
an obgyn, is that there is
outstanding evidence to show

00:50:12.782 --> 00:50:15.750
that there are no reproductive
consequences for those getting
the vaccine.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.720
It is safe for reproduction, and

00:50:20.423 --> 00:50:22.423
it is safe to go into pregnancy.

00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:26.995
Even in my own geographic area
we lost moms and babies because

00:50:29.865 --> 00:50:31.865
the effect on women was far more

00:50:32.234 --> 00:50:34.234
than expected, and vaccination

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.670
is really important protection.

00:50:37.506 --> 00:50:39.506
Having said all that, there are

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.309
real reasons why people cannot
get the vaccine.

00:50:43.111 --> 00:50:45.444
You MAY think some are
illegitimate, and some MAY have

00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:47.915
very well-founded medical
reasons.

00:50:50.118 --> 00:50:52.118
But that's not up to you.

00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:54.186
And the fact of the matter is do

00:50:54.822 --> 00:50:56.822
you know that one-third of our

00:50:57.325 --> 00:50:58.758
healthcare workers are
unvaccinated.

00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:01.940
They have chosen not to be
vaccinated.

00:51:02.163 --> 00:51:04.163
This is why the vaccine mandate

00:51:05.232 --> 00:51:07.800
is such a staggering risk to our
healthcare system going forward.

00:51:09.303 --> 00:51:11.303
Because if we fire one-third of

00:51:12.639 --> 00:51:14.639
our healthcare staff when we

00:51:14.641 --> 00:51:16.641
already can't man our hospitals,

00:51:16.777 --> 00:51:19.612
we're going to be in profound
jeopardy.
People who are on the front

00:51:20.414 --> 00:51:22.414
lines get to have the privacy to

00:51:23.116 --> 00:51:25.584
make their own decisions about
healthcare, including
vaccination.

00:51:26.285 --> 00:51:28.854
If they're on the front lines
protecting you either as a first

00:51:29.823 --> 00:51:31.823
responder or as a healthcare

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.920
provider, we need to give them

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.940
workman's comp because they're

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.463
doing the yeoman's work in this
epidemic.

00:51:40.466 --> 00:51:42.466
I would ask you to not support

00:51:46.172 --> 00:51:47.906
this legislation from my friend,
the sneer from fairfax, and I

00:51:48.741 --> 00:51:51.143
will not be supporting it, and
there are very good reasons why

00:51:51.143 --> 00:51:53.843
you should not as well.
Thank you.

00:51:54.546 --> 00:51:56.814
>> the senator from alexandria,
senator ebbin.

00:51:57.516 --> 00:51:59.516
>> would the senior senator from

00:51:59.551 --> 00:52:01.551
fairfax yield for a question?

00:52:01.987 --> 00:52:04.855
>> will the senator yield?
>> I yield.
>> senator ebbin?

00:52:06.258 --> 00:52:08.392
>> I would ask the senator,
remind him.

00:52:08.693 --> 00:52:11.462
I heard the senator from
lynchburg talk about how some of

00:52:14.466 --> 00:52:16.766
our colleagues who have covid,
he believes they have been

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.766
vaccinated.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.105
He said that he got the, quote,
the exact same covid as other

00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:23.105
people.

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.641
Would the senator agree that the

00:52:38.521 --> 00:52:41.491
vaccination.
>> the fatalities of those who

00:52:42.925 --> 00:52:45.595

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.397
thousand of those who have been
unvaccinate

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:54.670
ed.
>> thank you, senator.

>> the junior senator from

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:00.875
richmond city, senator

00:53:01.243 --> 00:53:03.345
morrissey.
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT,

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.120
would the senior senator from

00:53:19.428 --> 00:53:20.895
enrico accept a question.
>> senator.

00:53:23.399 --> 00:53:25.466
>> the senator has the floor.
>> you made three points and I

00:53:26.535 --> 00:53:28.836
wanted to ask you about the
third points.

00:53:30.138 --> 00:53:32.138
Third, said there were no

00:53:32.274 --> 00:53:34.709
long-term negative consequence
tots vaccine because the affects

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:36.810
show in quick order.

00:53:37.678 --> 00:53:39.678
You said number two, that the

00:53:40.515 --> 00:53:42.515
empirical evidence is somewhat

00:53:44.385 --> 00:53:46.385
certain that there is efficacy

00:53:46.487 --> 00:53:49.560
in this vaccination, and the
third reason is there are real

00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:52.920
reasons for not getting
vaccinated.

00:53:52.627 --> 00:53:54.627
Could the senator explain any of

00:53:55.629 --> 00:53:58.264
those reasons for not getting
vaccinated?
>> senator dunnavant?

00:53:58.466 --> 00:54:00.466
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT,

00:54:00.868 --> 00:54:03.570
I'll start by saying, to be very
precise because precision in

00:54:04.738 --> 00:54:06.738
language is the job we have in

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.710
the senate.

00:54:12.913 --> 00:54:14.913
I said that we have no evidence

00:54:18.515 --> 00:54:20.515
that the vaccination causes

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.588
long-term consequence.
I explained the biology of that

00:54:25.355 --> 00:54:27.356
and we can never say never, but
we've had hundreds of millions

00:54:28.459 --> 00:54:30.459
of people across the world now

00:54:30.862 --> 00:54:33.463
be vaccinated with this vaccine
and we have very good evidence

00:54:34.565 --> 00:54:36.565
of what the precise risk are.

00:54:38.102 --> 00:54:41.700
But things that show up much
later.
Thanks that show up after

00:54:42.272 --> 00:54:44.874
vaccination show up within the
first two months.

00:54:45.409 --> 00:54:47.409
Real reasons that you cannot get

00:54:48.345 --> 00:54:50.345
the vaccine are often medical.

00:54:51.448 --> 00:54:53.448
They MAY involve things like

00:54:54.551 --> 00:54:56.551
certain autoimmune disorders,

00:54:57.454 --> 00:54:59.454
they MAY involve clotting

00:54:59.723 --> 00:55:01.723
disorders and other medical

00:55:01.957 --> 00:55:04.227
indications where people have
been told they should not get

00:55:04.227 --> 00:55:07.129
the vaccination.
Even though people, you know,

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.699
this is really -- if we want to
get back to consistency in our

00:55:11.232 --> 00:55:13.668
language, and what we do and
what we expect, this is a

00:55:13.703 --> 00:55:16.605
conversation between a doctor
and a patient.

00:55:17.173 --> 00:55:19.173
I'm not an especiallyist in

00:55:19.575 --> 00:55:21.743
every arena, but I know there
are certain specialist who is

00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:25.130
have advised against patients
getting this.

00:55:26.514 --> 00:55:28.514
I probably can't list all the

00:55:28.516 --> 00:55:30.819
diseases for you, but they're
legitimate.
And those are a couple of

00:55:30.819 --> 00:55:33.152
examples.
>> thank you, senator.

00:55:33.722 --> 00:55:35.722
Will the senator yield for one

00:55:35.824 --> 00:55:37.691
final question.
>> will the senator yield?

00:55:37.893 --> 00:55:39.893
>> yes.

00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:43.129
>> the senator has

00:55:45.667 --> 00:55:47.667
.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.938
>> could you give the number of
percentage of people who are in

00:55:51.372 --> 00:55:53.372
this population that people

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.509
could be at risk if they got a
vaccination?

00:55:56.476 --> 00:55:58.745
You said there were many reasons
out there.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.480
What percentage of the

00:56:01.615 --> 00:56:03.615
population, if you have one, who

00:56:06.987 --> 00:56:08.987
are in that risk category.

00:56:09.355 --> 00:56:11.355
>> senator dunnavant.

00:56:11.692 --> 00:56:13.860
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, I would say
I have no idea.

00:56:15.128 --> 00:56:17.296
I think it is far beyond the
scope of this body to be trying

00:56:18.932 --> 00:56:20.932
to discern what is a valid

00:56:22.536 --> 00:56:24.536
medical reason and what is not.

00:56:25.572 --> 00:56:27.907
Furthermore, I think that this
entire conversation about why I

00:56:31.177 --> 00:56:33.177
am or am not vaccinated is a

00:56:34.814 --> 00:56:36.714
shocking violation of privacy in
medicine.

00:56:39.218 --> 00:56:41.319
And I believe that there are
principles upon which we can

00:56:41.687 --> 00:56:43.687
make this decision that have to

00:56:44.357 --> 00:56:47.125
do with the fact that we can't
control every decision that
everybody makes.

00:56:49.628 --> 00:56:51.628
In healthcare, that is an arena

00:56:51.797 --> 00:56:53.797
where we really should respect

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.600
someone's intelligence to

00:56:56.668 --> 00:56:58.668
discern and decide an

00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:01.772
intervention of whether they're
going to receive medicine,

00:57:02.308 --> 00:57:04.874
whether it be vaccination or
something else, what we need to

00:57:07.311 --> 00:57:09.446
be doing here, protect workman's
comp, people on the front lines

00:57:10.248 --> 00:57:13.183
and who are in the business of
taking care of this pep
democrat.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.722
>> okay. I thank the senator.
>> the senior senator from

00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:21.926
richmond p senator mcclelland.
>> thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT.

00:57:22.694 --> 00:57:24.828
Speaking to the bill.
>> senator has the floor.

00:57:25.696 --> 00:57:28.230
>> I want to get us back to what
the bill actually does.

00:57:30.134 --> 00:57:31.901
This is not a bill that mandates
a vaccine.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.538
This is not a bill that says
you'll get fired if you don't

00:57:37.408 --> 00:57:39.408
get a vaccine.

00:57:39.576 --> 00:57:41.576
Under current law, if you read

00:57:42.912 --> 00:57:44.912
the bill, there is a presumption

00:57:45.347 --> 00:57:47.516
for certain employees in
high-risk jobs, healthcare

00:57:49.319 --> 00:57:51.854
workers, that if they get covid,
they got it in the course of

00:57:53.388 --> 00:57:55.491
their work and are eligible for
workers comp.

00:57:57.592 --> 00:57:59.592
That's a rebuttable presumption.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.280
Under current law, if their

00:58:03.199 --> 00:58:06.100
employer offered them the
vaccine, and they didn't take

00:58:09.705 --> 00:58:12.340
it, they're not entitled to that
presumption.
It doesn't matter why they

00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:15.744
didn't take it.
If the employer offers it, and

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.120
they don't take t they don't get

00:58:19.648 --> 00:58:21.948
the presumption.
So that's current law.

00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:26.119
What this bill does is just

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:30.625
changed that to say, whether the
employer offered it or not, if

00:58:32.361 --> 00:58:34.361
you didn't take it, you don't

00:58:34.896 --> 00:58:36.896
get the presumption.

00:58:37.165 --> 00:58:39.266
let's debate what the bill
actually does and not what it

00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:41.266
doesn't do.

00:58:46.674 --> 00:58:48.674
Thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT.

00:58:50.478 --> 00:58:52.478
>> the question is, shall senate

00:58:56.949 --> 00:58:59.152
bill -- does senior senator from
fairfax, senator saslaw.

00:58:59.653 --> 00:59:01.653
>> there are a couple of things

00:59:02.989 --> 00:59:04.989
said during this debate.

00:59:06.826 --> 00:59:08.826
>> are the senators -- what is the

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.464
purpose of the senator rising.
>> to wrap this up and answer

00:59:11.965 --> 00:59:13.965
some of the things that were

00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:16.134
stated that were not accurate.

00:59:18.171 --> 00:59:20.171
>> the senator has the floor.

00:59:20.173 --> 00:59:22.173
>> as the senior senator from

00:59:26.379 --> 00:59:28.379
richmond has said, this bill

00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:33.484
bill -- essentially, deals with a

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:39.560
situation that -- with employment.

00:59:47.766 --> 00:59:49.766
I would say to senator

00:59:52.404 --> 00:59:54.404
dunnavant, there is explanation

01:00:02.981 --> 01:00:05.216
in this bill that you can still
get workman's comp.

01:00:06.118 --> 01:00:08.118
You heard from the senator from

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880
chesterfield, they ought to have

01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:15.793
a choice between job or jab.
You don't get laid off for not

01:00:15.793 --> 01:00:17.793
getting this shot.

01:00:18.563 --> 01:00:20.300
This has to do with getting
workman's comp.

01:00:22.899 --> 01:00:24.899
And finally I would say to the

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.350
senator from lynchburg, I don't

01:00:27.537 --> 01:00:29.537
put in mean-spirited bills, and

01:00:30.373 --> 01:00:33.175
neither is this mean spirited.
This bill simply deals with a

01:00:33.609 --> 01:00:35.609
problem, and I might add that

01:00:36.212 --> 01:00:38.212
not one of these organizations

01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:41.282
that are affected by this showed

01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:43.751
up to testify against the bill.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880
Not a one.

01:00:49.558 --> 01:00:51.558
With that, I would renew my

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:55.829
motion for passage.

01:00:57.432 --> 01:00:59.432
>> the question is, shall senate

01:01:00.268 --> 01:01:03.170

All in favor of the motion will

record their votes aye.
Those opposed no.

01:01:07.476 --> 01:01:09.476
Are the senators ready to vote?

01:01:11.946 --> 01:01:13.946
Have all the senators voted?

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.882
>> senator bell hours do you

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:19.719

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:43.267
senator edwards.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, I move that

01:02:43.935 --> 01:02:46.360
senate bill 422 pass.
By way of explanation.

01:02:46.838 --> 01:02:49.706
>> the senator has the floor.
>> this grew out of a study from

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.210
the joint commission on
healthcare.

01:02:54.645 --> 01:02:57.447
It is a unanimous recommendation
of the joint commission on

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.885
healthcare that this bill be
reported.

01:03:05.654 --> 01:03:08.424
it is designed to improve
forward ability in health

01:03:11.394 --> 01:03:13.394
insurance, and by way of

01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:16.766
explanation, currently, the
affordable care act authorizes

01:03:18.133 --> 01:03:20.133
insurance companies to charge a

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:22.170
tobacco surcharge, an additional

01:03:23.406 --> 01:03:25.406
charge for those up to 50% more

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:27.420
than for those who are
non-smokers.

01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:30.977
And this is under the theory

01:03:33.214 --> 01:03:35.214
that toe back toe surcharge was

01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:37.985
supposed to encourage tobacco

01:03:41.424 --> 01:03:44.292
users to cease smoking.
The study shows that it simply

01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:47.661
does not work.

01:03:51.932 --> 01:03:53.932
Encouraging tobacco users to buy

01:03:56.571 --> 01:03:58.571
health insurance provides health

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:06.460
provider toss work with

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840
cessation before they get sick.

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.620
The tobacco sur discharge will

01:04:16.224 --> 01:04:18.358
reduce premiums in the market
and increase the number of

01:04:19.393 --> 01:04:21.393
people who would be insured.

01:04:21.862 --> 01:04:24.731
The staff found that by
eliminating the tobacco

01:04:26.767 --> 01:04:28.767
surcharge, it is likely that the

01:04:31.872 --> 01:04:33.439
premiums will fall between 3% to
4.5%.

01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:35.974
And the increase, there will be
an increase of the number of

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:40.210
people in the mark for health

01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:43.481
insurance by 9,000 to 13,000.

01:04:44.818 --> 01:04:46.818
Up to 14,000 uninsured people

01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:49.188
will not be uninsured but will
be insured.

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.590
So the point is, the surcharge

01:04:53.159 --> 01:04:54.526
does not discourage people from
smoking.

01:04:55.161 --> 01:04:57.620
But it discourage people from
buying insurance.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.400
And it is important for more and
more people to buy insurance

01:05:02.934 --> 01:05:04.934
because more people who purchase

01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:09.542
health insurance, it spreads the
risk and lowers the cost across

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.542
the board.

01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:13.777
If you want health insurance to

01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:16.346
go down, pass the bill.

01:05:22.287 --> 01:05:24.922
Thank you, MADAM PRESIDENT.
>> the senator from southern

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.126
fairfax county, senator barker.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, I would like

01:05:28.126 --> 01:05:30.893
to speak to the bill.
>> the senator has the floor.

01:05:32.664 --> 01:05:34.664
>> yes, and I would thank the

01:05:34.699 --> 01:05:37.234
senator from roanoke city for
carrying this bill and for his

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:39.504
work on the joint commission on
healthcare.

01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:43.673
I think he has it exactly

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.800
correct by saying that the right

01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:49.378
now insurance companies can

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:52.130
charge as much as 50% higher

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:55.650
premium to people who sign up
for health insurance when they

01:05:57.588 --> 01:05:59.588
are smokers, and they confess to

01:05:59.757 --> 01:06:02.690
that, basically.
That deters many of them from

01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:05.594
being able to get insurance

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:07.363
coverage because they could not
afford it.

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.199
Which has a negative affect upon
them.

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.537
And it does not incentivize them

01:06:19.674 --> 01:06:21.600
successfully, at least, to not
smoke.

01:06:22.743 --> 01:06:25.478
To quit smoking and go through
some system.

01:06:26.147 --> 01:06:28.447
Whereas if they have health
insurance coverage and they deal

01:06:28.983 --> 01:06:31.751
with provider who is are taking
care of them, there is more

01:06:31.884 --> 01:06:34.454
likelihood that they would get
into a program.

01:06:34.687 --> 01:06:36.687
It is important that we pass

01:06:37.124 --> 01:06:39.124
this bill to reduce the cost of

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:42.828
care, to provide access, health
insurance coverage for more

01:06:43.597 --> 01:06:45.597
people, and to reduce smoking

01:06:45.832 --> 01:06:47.832
and the negative effects from

01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:52.171
that, from the citizens of the
commonwealth.

01:06:52.939 --> 01:06:54.939
With that I would urge everyone

01:06:56.777 --> 01:06:58.777
with the bill introduced by the

01:07:03.483 --> 01:07:05.483
